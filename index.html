        <h2>A slightly comedic take on the classic Tic Tac Toe game!</h2>
        <p>Find a friend and take turns placing toes and tacks on the game board below! Player One will start by placing a toe in any squuare of their choice, followed by Player Two placing a tack on any square of their choice. The game will continue in this fashion until one player acheives three of their symbols in a row, or until the board is full.</p>
